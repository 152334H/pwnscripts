# Contributing to pwnscripts
Please send all pull requests through the [dev](https://github.com/152334H/pwnscripts/tree/dev) branch.

If your pull request changes pwnscripts code, try to make sure that `pytest` passes first. If you're making new features (!), make sure to add documentation and tests (if needed) to go along with it.
